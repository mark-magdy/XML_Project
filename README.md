# XML Toolkit: A C++ Project with GUI and Command Line Modes

Welcome to the XML Toolkit! This versatile project offers both **GUI** and **Command Line** modes to process XML files efficiently. The toolkit provides essential functions such as formatting, conversion, minification, and compression of XML data. 

## Features

### 1. **Formatting (Prettifying) the XML**
   - Ensures your XML file is well-formatted with proper indentation for each level.
   - Makes XML files easier to read and debug.

### 2. **Converting XML to JSON**
   - Transforms XML data into JSON format for easier integration with JavaScript and other modern frameworks.
   - Useful for handling XML in web-based environments.

### 3. **Minifying the XML File**
   - Reduces the size of XML files by removing unnecessary whitespaces and newlines.
   - Ideal for optimizing storage and improving transmission efficiency.

### 4. **Compressing the Data**
   - Compresses XML or JSON files using a custom or standard compression technique (e.g., byte pair encoding).
   - Reduces file size for faster data transfers and efficient storage.

## Project Modes

### **1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Mode**
   - User-friendly interface for non-technical users.
   - Provides buttons and menus to perform operations like formatting, converting, minifying, and compressing files.

### **2. Command Line (CLI) Mode**
   - Powerful mode for advanced users and developers.
   - Execute operations using command-line arguments for seamless automation and scripting.

## How It Works

1. **Formatting**: Automatically detects XML structure and applies appropriate indentation.
2. **Conversion**: Parses XML data into a JSON structure while maintaining data integrity.
3. **Minification**: Strips unnecessary characters to produce a compact XML file.
4. **Compression**: Leverages innovative algorithms to encode and compress the XML/JSON files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/) (for GUI mode).
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building the project.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xml-toolkit.git
   cd xml-toolkit
